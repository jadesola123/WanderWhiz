# WanderMind
WanderMind is a fun and interactive platform that allows users to chat with it while sharing and displaying memes in real-time. THis is my final project from the Shecode Africa cloud school and my submission for #GitHubHack23

Presentation Tier:

This tier represents the user interface and handles the presentation logic of your application.
It includes components such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that render the chat interface and display memes to the user.
The presentation tier interacts with the other tiers to send and receive data and provide a seamless user experience.
Application Tier:

This tier contains the business logic and application functionality.
It handles the processing of user inputs, meme generation, and communication with external services.
The application tier integrates with the data tier to retrieve and store data related to users, chat history, and memes.
Data Tier:

This tier involves the storage and management of data used by your application.
In your case, you are using Azure SQL DB and Blob storage as the data tier.
Azure SQL DB is used for storing structured data such as user information and chat history. It provides a reliable and scalable database service.
Blob storage is utilized for storing the meme images generated by your application. It offers scalable object storage for unstructured data like images and provides efficient retrieval and serving of static content.
